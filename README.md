# Ruby's Adventure

Developed from the Unity Engine tutorial "Ruby's Adventure" and taken a little farther.

## Plans

Add more areas for Ruby to explore, maybe some new terrain, new monsters, new items ... you know, content!

For specifics, check the Issues tab at the top.

Need more art assets overall. Could also really use some 2D particle effects that aren't terrible.

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to Unity and their team for creating (almost all) of the Assets currently being used in the project.
