# Ruby's Adventure

Developed from the Unity Engine tutorial "Ruby's Adventure" and taken a little farther.

## Plans

Add more areas for Ruby to explore, maybe some new terrain, new monsters, new items ... you know, content!

For specifics, check the Issues tab at the top.

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to Unity and their team for creating (almost all) of the Assets currently being used in the project.
